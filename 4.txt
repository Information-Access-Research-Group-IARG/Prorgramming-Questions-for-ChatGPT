To define a Unicode string in C, you can use the `wchar_t` data type along with the `L` prefix before the string literal. Here's an example:

```c
#include <wchar.h>

int main() {
    wchar_t unicodeString[] = L"Hello, 世界!";
    
    // Rest of your code...
    
    return 0;
}
```

In the above code, the `wchar_t` data type is used to represent wide characters, which can store Unicode characters. The `L` prefix before the string literal indicates that it is a wide string.

Note that you may need to ensure that your compiler and environment support Unicode and have the necessary libraries and settings in place to handle Unicode strings properly.
