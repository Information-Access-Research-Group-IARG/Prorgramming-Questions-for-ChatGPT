To read a *.csv file into RAM using the standard library in portable standard ISO C++20, you can use the following code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <string>
#include <vector>

int main() {
    std::ifstream file("example.csv");
    std::vector<std::vector<std::string>> data;

    std::string line;
    while (std::getline(file, line)) {
        std::vector<std::string> row;
        std::string cell;
        std::istringstream lineStream(line);

        while (std::getline(lineStream, cell, ',')) {
            row.push_back(cell);
        }

        data.push_back(row);
    }

    // Now you have the CSV data stored in the 'data' vector

    // Example usage: Print the CSV data
    for (const auto& row : data) {
        for (const auto& cell : row) {
            std::cout << cell << " ";
        }
        std::cout << std::endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

This code reads the contents of the "example.csv" file and stores it in a 2D vector called `data`. Each row of the CSV file is represented by a vector of strings, and the entire CSV data is stored in the `data` vector.

You can replace "example.csv" with the path to your actual CSV file. Make sure the file is in the correct format with comma-separated values.

Note: This code uses only the standard library and does not require any external libraries.
