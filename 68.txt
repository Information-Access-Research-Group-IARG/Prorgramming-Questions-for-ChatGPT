To perform a principal component analysis (PCA) of a matrix A in FORTRAN, you can use the LAPACK library. LAPACK (Linear Algebra PACKage) is a widely used library for numerical linear algebra computations.

Here are the steps to run a PCA using LAPACK in FORTRAN:

1. Make sure you have LAPACK installed on your system. If not, you can download and install it from the official LAPACK website.

2. Include the LAPACK library in your FORTRAN program by adding the following line at the beginning of your code:
   ```fortran
   include 'lapack.f'
   ```

3. Declare the necessary variables for the PCA computation, such as the input matrix A, the output eigenvalues and eigenvectors, and other required variables.

4. Call the LAPACK routine `DGESVD` to compute the singular value decomposition (SVD) of matrix A. The SVD is closely related to PCA and can be used to compute the principal components. The `DGESVD` routine computes the singular value decomposition of a general rectangular matrix.

   Here's an example of how to call the `DGESVD` routine:
   ```fortran
   call DGESVD('A', 'A', m, n, A, lda, S, U, ldu, VT, ldvt, work, lwork, info)
   ```

   In the above example, `m` and `n` are the dimensions of matrix A, `A` is the input matrix, `S` is the output singular values, `U` is the output left singular vectors, `VT` is the output right singular vectors, and `work` is a workspace array. The other parameters are integers specifying the leading dimensions of the arrays.

5. After calling `DGESVD`, you can use the computed singular values and singular vectors to perform PCA. The principal components are given by the columns of the matrix `VT`.

Regarding the most efficient portable library for PCA in FORTRAN, LAPACK is a highly efficient and widely used library for numerical linear algebra computations. It is portable and available on various platforms. Therefore, LAPACK is a good choice for performing PCA in FORTRAN.
