Sure! Here's an example of C code to start and stop a precise timer for code benchmarking:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <time.h>

int main() {
    // Start the timer
    clock_t start = clock();

    // Code to be benchmarked
    // ...

    // Stop the timer
    clock_t end = clock();

    // Calculate the elapsed time in seconds
    double elapsed_time = (double)(end - start) / CLOCKS_PER_SEC;

    printf("Elapsed time: %.2f seconds\n", elapsed_time);

    return 0;
}
```

In this code, we use the `clock()` function from the `time.h` library to measure the CPU time used by the code between the start and end points. The `CLOCKS_PER_SEC` constant is used to convert the CPU time to seconds.

You can place your code to be benchmarked between the start and end points. The elapsed time will be printed to the console.

Remember to compile and run this code using a C compiler, such as GCC, on your macOS system.
