In C++, you can use the logical OR operator (`||`) to check whether a value is any one of a list of expressions. Here's an example:

```cpp
int value = 5;
if (value == 1 || value == 3 || value == 5) {
    // Value is any one of 1, 3, or 5
    // Add your code here
}
```

In this example, the `if` statement checks whether the `value` is equal to 1, 3, or 5. If any of these conditions are true, the code inside the `if` block will be executed. You can add your own code inside the `if` block to perform the desired actions.
