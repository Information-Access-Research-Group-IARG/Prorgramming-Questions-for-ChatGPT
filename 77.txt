The code is attempting to concatenate two strings using the `strcat` function, but it is trying to concatenate the second string to a string literal, which is read-only. This will result in undefined behavior. To fix this, you can declare an array of characters instead of a pointer and use `strcpy` to copy the string literal into the array. Here's the corrected code:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int main() {
    char s[20] = "Hello, ";
    strcat(s, "World!");
    puts(s);
    return 0;
}
```

In this code, we declare an array `s` with enough space to hold both strings. Then we use `strcpy` to copy the string literal "Hello, " into `s`. Finally, we use `strcat` to concatenate "World!" to `s`, resulting in the desired output "Hello, World!".
