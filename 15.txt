To print a contingency matrix in Julia, you can use the `contingency` function from the `StatsBase` package. Here's an example:

```julia
using StatsBase

# Example data
actual = [1, 2, 1, 2, 1]
predicted = [1, 1, 2, 2, 1]

# Compute the contingency matrix
cm = contingency(actual, predicted)

# Print the contingency matrix
println(cm)
```

This will output the contingency matrix, which shows the counts of the different combinations of actual and predicted values.
