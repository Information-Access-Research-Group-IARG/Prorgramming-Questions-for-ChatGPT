To compute the standard deviation of an array in JavaScript, you can use the following steps:

1. Calculate the mean (average) of the array elements.
2. Subtract the mean from each element and square the result.
3. Calculate the mean of the squared differences.
4. Take the square root of the mean of the squared differences.

Here's an example code snippet that demonstrates how to compute the standard deviation of an array in JavaScript:

```javascript
function calculateStandardDeviation(array) {
  // Step 1: Calculate the mean
  const mean = array.reduce((acc, val) => acc + val, 0) / array.length;

  // Step 2: Subtract the mean from each element and square the result
  const squaredDifferences = array.map(val => Math.pow(val - mean, 2));

  // Step 3: Calculate the mean of the squared differences
  const meanOfSquaredDifferences = squaredDifferences.reduce((acc, val) => acc + val, 0) / squaredDifferences.length;

  // Step 4: Take the square root of the mean of the squared differences
  const standardDeviation = Math.sqrt(meanOfSquaredDifferences);

  return standardDeviation;
}

// Example usage
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const result = calculateStandardDeviation(numbers);
console.log(result); // Output: 1.4142135623730951
```

In this example, the `calculateStandardDeviation` function takes an array as input and returns the standard deviation of the array elements. The `console.log` statement outputs the result, which is `1.4142135623730951` in this case.
