In Julia, you can define a three-dimensional matrix of floats using the `Array` type. Here's an example:

```julia
# Create a 3x3x3 matrix of floats
matrix = Array{Float64}(undef, 3, 3, 3)

# Accessing elements
matrix[1, 2, 3] = 1.5
element = matrix[1, 2, 3]

# Printing the matrix
println(matrix)
```

This will create a 3x3x3 matrix of `Float64` (64-bit floating-point) values. You can access and modify individual elements using indexing, just like with a regular matrix.
