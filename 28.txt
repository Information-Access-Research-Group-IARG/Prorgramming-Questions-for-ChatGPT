In Rust, you can design functions to return errors systematically by using the `Result` type. The `Result` type is an enum that represents either a successful value (`Ok`) or an error (`Err`).

To design functions that return errors systematically, you can define the return type of the function as `Result<T, E>`, where `T` is the type of the successful value and `E` is the type of the error.

Here's an example of a function that returns a `Result`:

```rust
fn divide(x: i32, y: i32) -> Result<i32, String> {
    if y == 0 {
        Err("Cannot divide by zero".to_string())
    } else {
        Ok(x / y)
    }
}
```

In this example, the `divide` function takes two `i32` arguments and returns a `Result<i32, String>`. If the second argument `y` is zero, it returns an `Err` variant with an error message. Otherwise, it returns an `Ok` variant with the result of the division.

To handle the returned `Result`, you can use the `match` expression or the `?` operator for error propagation. Here's an example:

```rust
fn main() {
    let result = divide(10, 2);
    
    match result {
        Ok(value) => println!("Result: {}", value),
        Err(error) => println!("Error: {}", error),
    }
}
```

In this example, the `match` expression is used to handle the `Result`. If the `Result` is `Ok`, it prints the result value. If the `Result` is `Err`, it prints the error message.

Alternatively, you can use the `?` operator for error propagation. Here's an example:

```rust
fn main() -> Result<(), String> {
    let result = divide(10, 0)?;
    println!("Result: {}", result);
    Ok(())
}
```

In this example, the `?` operator is used to propagate the error. If the `divide` function returns an `Err`, the error will be propagated to the caller of the `main` function.

By using the `Result` type and appropriate error handling, you can design functions to return errors systematically in Rust.
