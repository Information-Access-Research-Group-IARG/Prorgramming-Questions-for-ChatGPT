In PROLOG, you can define family relationships using facts and rules. Here's an example of how you can define family relationships for father, mother, brother, sister, grandparents, aunties, and uncles:

```prolog
% Facts
father(john, jim). % John is the father of Jim
father(john, lisa). % John is the father of Lisa
mother(lisa, anna). % Lisa is the mother of Anna
mother(lisa, david). % Lisa is the mother of David

% Rules
parent(X, Y) :- father(X, Y). % X is the parent of Y if X is the father of Y
parent(X, Y) :- mother(X, Y). % X is the parent of Y if X is the mother of Y

sibling(X, Y) :- parent(Z, X), parent(Z, Y), X \= Y. % X and Y are siblings if they have the same parent and are not the same person

grandparent(X, Y) :- parent(X, Z), parent(Z, Y). % X is the grandparent of Y if X is the parent of Z and Z is the parent of Y

% Examples
?- father(john, jim). % Query to check if John is the father of Jim
Yes. % Output: Yes, John is the father of Jim

?- sibling(jim, lisa). % Query to check if Jim and Lisa are siblings
No. % Output: No, Jim and Lisa are not siblings

?- grandparent(john, anna). % Query to check if John is the grandparent of Anna
Yes. % Output: Yes, John is the grandparent of Anna
```

You can add more facts and rules to define additional family relationships as needed.
