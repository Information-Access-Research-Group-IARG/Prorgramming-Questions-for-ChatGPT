# Prorgramming-Questions-for-ChatGPT
This GitHub repository contains a set of Question Collections for evaluating the ability of machine learning models like ChatGPT to program, i.e. to help solve coding questions.

The corpus was collected for a study presented at the Workshop on AI for AI Learning held at the European Conference on Artificial Intelligence (ECAI) in Krakow, Poland in October 2023.
