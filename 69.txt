To compute the standard deviation of an array in FORTRAN, you can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the mean of the array elements.
2. Subtract the mean from each element of the array.
3. Square each of the differences obtained in step 2.
4. Calculate the mean of the squared differences.
5. Take the square root of the mean obtained in step 4.

Here is an example code snippet that demonstrates how to compute the standard deviation of an array in FORTRAN:

```fortran
program standard_deviation
  implicit none
  integer, parameter :: n = 10 ! number of elements in the array
  real :: array(n) ! array of real numbers
  real :: mean, variance, std_dev
  integer :: i

  ! Initialize the array with some values
  array = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0, 7.0, 8.0, 9.0, 10.0]

  ! Calculate the mean
  mean = sum(array) / n

  ! Calculate the variance
  variance = 0.0
  do i = 1, n
    variance = variance + (array(i) - mean)**2
  end do
  variance = variance / n

  ! Calculate the standard deviation
  std_dev = sqrt(variance)

  ! Print the result
  print *, "Standard Deviation:", std_dev
end program standard_deviation
```

In this example, we have an array of 10 real numbers. You can modify the array size and values according to your requirements. The program calculates the mean, variance, and standard deviation of the array and prints the result.
