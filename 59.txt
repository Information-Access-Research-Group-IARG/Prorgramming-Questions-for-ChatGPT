In C++, you can use the `switch` statement to check whether a value is any one of a list of constants. Here's an example:

```cpp
int value = 5;

switch (value) {
    case 1:
        // code to execute if value is 1
        break;
    case 2:
        // code to execute if value is 2
        break;
    case 3:
    case 4:
    case 5:
        // code to execute if value is 3, 4, or 5
        break;
    default:
        // code to execute if value doesn't match any of the cases
        break;
}
```

In this example, the `switch` statement checks the value of the variable `value` against different cases. If the value matches any of the cases, the corresponding code block is executed. The `break` statement is used to exit the `switch` statement after executing the code for the matching case. If the value doesn't match any of the cases, the code in the `default` case is executed.
