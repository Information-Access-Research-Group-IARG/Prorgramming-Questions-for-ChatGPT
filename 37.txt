In Kotlin, the syntax for anonymous functions is as follows:

```
val functionName = fun(parameters): returnType {
    // function body
}
```

For example, here's an anonymous function that takes two integers as parameters and returns their sum:

```
val sum = fun(a: Int, b: Int): Int {
    return a + b
}
```

You can then call the anonymous function like any other function:

```
val result = sum(3, 5) // result will be 8
```
