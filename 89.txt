In C, the `volatile` keyword is used to indicate that a variable may be modified by external sources that are not within the control of the program. It tells the compiler not to optimize or cache the variable, as its value can change unexpectedly. This is commonly used when working with hardware registers, interrupt service routines, or multi-threaded environments where variables can be modified by other threads or processes.
