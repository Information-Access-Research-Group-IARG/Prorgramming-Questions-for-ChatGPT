To plot a ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) curve in Julia, you can use the `ROCAnalysis.jl` package. Here are the steps to plot a ROC curve:

1. Install the `ROCAnalysis.jl` package by running the following command in the Julia REPL:
   ```julia
   using Pkg
   Pkg.add("ROCAnalysis")
   ```

2. Once the package is installed, you can load it into your Julia session:
   ```julia
   using ROCAnalysis
   ```

3. Prepare your data. You will need the true labels and predicted scores or probabilities for your binary classification problem.

4. Create an `ROCData` object using the true labels and predicted scores:
   ```julia
   roc_data = ROCData(labels, scores)
   ```

   Replace `labels` with an array of true labels (0 or 1) and `scores` with an array of predicted scores or probabilities.

5. Plot the ROC curve using the `plot` function:
   ```julia
   plot(roc_data)
   ```

   This will generate a plot of the ROC curve.

You can customize the plot by specifying additional arguments to the `plot` function. For example, you can set the title, labels, and line style. Refer to the `ROCAnalysis.jl` documentation for more details on customization options.

Note: Make sure you have a plotting backend installed in Julia, such as `Plots.jl`, to display the plot. If you don't have a plotting backend installed, you can install `Plots.jl` by running `Pkg.add("Plots")` and then load it with `using Plots`.
