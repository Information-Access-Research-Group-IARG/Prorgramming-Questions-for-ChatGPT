Here are the bugs and deficiencies in the provided C code:

1. Memory Leak: The code allocates memory for `nb__net_state` using `malloc`, but it does not free the memory when it is no longer needed. This can lead to memory leaks and potential resource issues.

2. Incomplete Error Handling: The code does not check if the memory allocation using `malloc` was successful or not. If the allocation fails, it will result in a NULL pointer assignment to `nb__net_state`, which can lead to undefined behavior when accessing its members.

3. Inconsistent Naming Convention: The function `nb__net_init` uses a mix of underscores and double underscores in its name. It is recommended to follow a consistent naming convention to improve code readability and maintainability.

4. Lack of Initialization: The code does not initialize the members of `nb__net_state` after allocating memory for it. This can lead to unpredictable behavior if the uninitialized members are accessed later in the code.

5. Lack of Error Handling for `nb__init_timers()`: The code does not handle any errors that may occur during the execution of `nb__init_timers()`. It is important to handle and propagate any errors to ensure proper functioning of the program.

To improve the code, you can consider the following changes:

```c
void nb__net_init(void) {
    nb__net_state = malloc(sizeof(*nb__net_state));
    if (nb__net_state == NULL) {
        // Handle memory allocation failure
        // ...
    }
    
    nb__init_timers();
    
    nb__net_state->num_conn = 0;
    
    // Initialize other members of nb__net_state if necessary
    // ...
}
```

In the updated code, the memory allocation is checked for success, and error handling is added if the allocation fails. Additionally, the `nb__init_timers()` function is called before accessing `nb__net_state` to ensure proper initialization.
