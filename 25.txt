To implement a singleton class in Java, you can follow the below steps:

1. Create a class and make its constructor private. This prevents other classes from instantiating the singleton class directly.

2. Declare a private static variable of the same class type inside the class. This variable will hold the single instance of the class.

3. Create a public static method that returns the single instance of the class. This method should check if the instance variable is null and create a new instance if it is. Otherwise, it should return the existing instance.

Here's an example implementation of a singleton class in Java:

```java
public class Singleton {
    private static Singleton instance;
    
    private Singleton() {
        // private constructor to prevent instantiation
    }
    
    public static Singleton getInstance() {
        if (instance == null) {
            instance = new Singleton();
        }
        return instance;
    }
}
```

You can then use the `getInstance()` method to access the single instance of the `Singleton` class:

```java
Singleton singleton = Singleton.getInstance();
```

This ensures that only one instance of the `Singleton` class is created throughout the application.
