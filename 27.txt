To view the compiled code for a function in Julia, you can use the `@code_llvm` or `@code_native` macros. These macros allow you to inspect the LLVM or native code generated by the Julia compiler for a specific function.

Here's an example of how to use these macros:

1. Start the Julia REPL by typing `julia` in your terminal.
2. Define a simple function, for example:

```julia
function myfunction(x)
    return x^2 + 2x + 1
end
```

3. To view the LLVM code for the function, use the `@code_llvm` macro followed by the function name:

```julia
@code_llvm myfunction
```

This will display the LLVM code generated by the Julia compiler for the `myfunction` function.

4. To view the native code for the function, use the `@code_native` macro followed by the function name:

```julia
@code_native myfunction
```

This will display the native code generated by the Julia compiler for the `myfunction` function.

Note that the output of these macros can be quite lengthy and complex, especially for more complex functions. You can also use the `@code_lowered` macro to view the lowered code, which is an intermediate representation of the code generated by the Julia compiler.
