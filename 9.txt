You can use the `turtle` module in Python to draw simple graphics using LOGO-like turtle graphics commands. Here's an example:

```python
import turtle

# Create a turtle object
t = turtle.Turtle()

# Move the turtle forward by 100 units
t.forward(100)

# Rotate the turtle left by 90 degrees
t.left(90)

# Move the turtle forward by 100 units
t.forward(100)

# Rotate the turtle left by 90 degrees
t.left(90)

# Move the turtle forward by 100 units
t.forward(100)

# Rotate the turtle left by 90 degrees
t.left(90)

# Move the turtle forward by 100 units
t.forward(100)

# Hide the turtle
t.hideturtle()

# Exit the turtle graphics window when clicked
turtle.exitonclick()
```

This code will create a turtle object, which you can use to draw various shapes and patterns by giving it commands like `forward()`, `backward()`, `left()`, `right()`, etc. You can also change the turtle's color, speed, and other attributes. The `turtle.exitonclick()` function will keep the turtle graphics window open until you click on it.

You can run this code in a Python script or in a Python interactive shell to see the turtle graphics in action.
