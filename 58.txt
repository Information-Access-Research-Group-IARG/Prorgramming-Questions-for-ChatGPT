To check whether a value is any one of a list of constants in Python, you can use the `in` operator. Here's an example:

```python
value = 5
constants = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

if value in constants:
    print("Value is one of the constants.")
else:
    print("Value is not one of the constants.")
```

In this example, the `in` operator checks if the `value` is present in the `constants` list. If it is, the program prints "Value is one of the constants." Otherwise, it prints "Value is not one of the constants."
