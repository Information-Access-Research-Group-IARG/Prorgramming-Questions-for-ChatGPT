In Swift, the minimum iPhone mobile app source code typically consists of the following:

```swift
import UIKit

class ViewController: UIViewController {
    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
        // Additional setup code can be added here
    }
}

let appDelegate = UIApplication.shared.delegate as! AppDelegate
appDelegate.window?.rootViewController = ViewController()
UIApplicationMain(CommandLine.argc, CommandLine.unsafeArgv, nil, NSStringFromClass(AppDelegate.self))
```

This code sets up a basic view controller (`ViewController`) and assigns it as the root view controller for the app's window. The `ViewController` class can be customized with additional code to define the app's behavior and user interface.

Note: This is a simplified example and does not include all the necessary code for a complete app. It assumes you have already set up the necessary project structure and dependencies.
