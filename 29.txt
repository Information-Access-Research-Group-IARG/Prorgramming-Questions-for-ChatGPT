In Rust, you can implement the equivalent of a class in Java or C++ using structs and impl blocks. Here's an example:

```rust
struct MyClass {
    // Fields
    field1: i32,
    field2: String,
}

impl MyClass {
    // Methods
    fn new(field1: i32, field2: String) -> Self {
        Self {
            field1,
            field2,
        }
    }

    fn method1(&self) {
        // Method implementation
    }

    fn method2(&mut self, param: i32) {
        // Method implementation
    }
}

fn main() {
    let mut my_object = MyClass::new(10, String::from("Hello"));
    my_object.method1();
    my_object.method2(20);
}
```

In this example, `MyClass` is defined as a struct with two fields `field1` and `field2`. The `impl` block is used to define methods associated with the struct. The `new` method is a constructor that creates a new instance of `MyClass`. The `method1` and `method2` methods are example methods that can be called on an instance of `MyClass`.

To create an instance of `MyClass`, you can use the `new` method as shown in the `main` function. You can then call the defined methods on the created object.

Note that Rust does not have traditional object-oriented features like inheritance, but you can achieve similar functionality using traits and composition.
