To generate a random number between 1 and 100 in C, you can use the `rand()` function from the `<stdlib.h>` library. Here's an example code snippet:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <time.h>

int main() {
    // Set the seed for the random number generator
    srand(time(NULL));

    // Generate a random number between 1 and 100
    int randomNumber = rand() % 100 + 1;

    printf("Random number between 1 and 100: %d\n", randomNumber);

    return 0;
}
```

In this code, `srand(time(NULL))` sets the seed for the random number generator based on the current time. This ensures that each time you run the program, you get a different sequence of random numbers.

`rand() % 100 + 1` generates a random number between 0 and 99 using the `rand()` function, and then adds 1 to the result to get a number between 1 and 100.

Finally, the generated random number is printed using `printf()`.
